    <div class="content">
        <p><i>The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer **Stan Lee** and artist **Jack Kirby**, the character first appeared in the debut issue of *The Incredible Hulk* (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character has dissociative identity disorder (DID) and is primarily represented by two alter egos: **Hulk**, a green-skinned, hulking humanoid possessing limitless physical strength, and **Dr. Robert Bruce Banner**, a socially withdrawn physicist who is weak and emotionally reserved. Both personas typically resent each other.</i></p>

        <h2>Origin Story:</h2>
        <p>Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving **Rick Jones** during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner transforms into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages, complicating Banner's civilian life.</p>

        <h3>Strength & Alter Egos:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Hulk’s strength is directly proportional to his anger, which makes him nearly invincible when enraged.</li>
            <li>The Hulk has been depicted in several forms, such as the mindless and destructive force (**War Hulk**), a brilliant warrior (**World-Breaker Hulk**), a self-hating protector (**Devil Hulk**), and a genius scientist (**Doc Green**).</li>
            <li>As a gangster, the Hulk also adopted the alter ego **Joe Fixit**.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supporting Cast & Villains:</h3>
        <p>Despite Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Betty Ross** – Banner’s love interest.</li>
            <li>**Rick Jones** – Banner’s best friend.</li>
            <li>**She-Hulk** – Banner’s cousin.</li>
            <li>**Doc Samson** – Banner’s therapist and ally.</li>
            <li>**Caiera** – Hulk's queen.</li>
            <li>**Korg** and **Miek** – Fellow warriors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Villains:</h3>
        <p>The Hulk has faced numerous enemies over the years, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**The Leader**</li>
            <li>**The Abomination**</li>
            <li>**The Absorbing Man**</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Despite his uncontrollable power, Hulk tries his best to do what's right while dealing with his emotional struggles and inner conflicts.</p>
